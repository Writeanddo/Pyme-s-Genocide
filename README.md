You playe as Pyme, a space adventurer looking for new adventures, but due to some problems in your trip the spaceship was damaged and crashed into an undiscovered planet full of misterious creatures. You will find that you can use your special hoover, Baku, to absorb and throw those creatures and even use them as fuel! They will still love you because they are cute AF, even when they are sacrificed. They don't event mind, they are always happy!!!

It was developed for **Ludum Dare 43**, "**You have to make sacrifices**".
